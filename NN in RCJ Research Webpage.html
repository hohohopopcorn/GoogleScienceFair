<p class="auto-style4">I am the captain and software writer of a Robotic Soccer 
team, <span class="auto-style6">Team Dimensions</span>, that competes in Robo 
Cup Junior. I have gone to the International level and even won 3rd Place World 
Wide. I am always seeking ways to perfect the robots. I am trying to find a 
robust way of locating the soccer ball because the infrared sensors cannot give 
me a definite position. <span class="auto-style7">I am going to try to use 4 sensors with 5 mini IR receivers to locate an 
infrared signal with respect to the center of the robot.</span> These sensors 
measure the intensity of IR.</p>

create a neural network that can accurately and efficiently predict where the

<p class="auto-style9"><strong><a name="Data_Collection">Data Collection</a></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4">I need to have a method to sample all the IR values of 
the reading, the distance from the ball, and the angle of the ball with respect 
to the y-axis increasing clockwise. I devised a method with the use of a slow 
moving motor to pull the ball and 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Production-Experience-Satisfied-Motorized-Rotating/dp/B00NAN3DCQ?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage">rotating lazy susan</a> to spin the robot.</p>

respect to the y-axis of the robot. The 
lazy susan will spin the robot at around 3 rotations per minute while the 
compass reads the angle with respect to the starting direction. Overall, the data is printed onto a serial monitor which is 
recorded onto an android.</p>

attached to a string which is pulled by a slow moving motor. The ball has a 
sheet of paper so that the robot knows what the distance of the ball is from the 
center of the robot. The ultrasonic sensor (<a href="https://www.parallax.com/product/28015">Ping))) 
sensor</a>) detects the paper's distance by measuring the time it takes for 
sound to travel to the paper, bounce off the paper and come back to the sensor.</p>

<p class="auto-style9"><strong><a name="The_Neural_Network_">The Neural Network</a></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4">Neural Network is a machine learning method of fitting a 
function to a set of data with inputs and outputs. It simulates the passing of 
information or values like the brain - information is passed through synapses in 
the brain and interpreted into another information in the neuron. The process of 
information being passed from neuron to neuron is what makes the Neural Network 
efficient in training as it also simulates how humans learn. From a past 
project, I have concluded a generic architecture of the Neural Network.</p>

<p class="auto-style9"><strong><a name="Training_">Training</a></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4">I set the <span class="auto-style13">20 IR raw values</span> directly from the mini sensors 
in the Hitechnic IR Seekers to be the input. The outputs are 
<span class="auto-style12">the angle of the 
ball with respect to the y-axis of the robot and distance away from the center 
of the robot</span>.</p>

<p class="auto-style9"><strong><a name="Result">Result</a></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4">The mean distance of the prediction to the actual point 
is 9cm, which is about one ball (7 cm) width. The standard deviation is 12cm, 
which is another 2 ball width. This result is already good enough to be used than 
my previous ball location program, which is made of hard-coded conditional 
statements and general approximations. However, the distribution of the distance 
is not normal as shown. There must be something that can improve the training 
and make the error more normally distributed.</p>

<p class="auto-style16"><strong><a name="New Method">New Method</a></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4">Since the angle is a periodic function, it might be hard 
to fit a non periodic function to it (as it is hard to fit a polynomial equation 
to sin(x) and other trigonometric functions). So I tried changing the outputs to 
x and y, setting the origin at the robot's center. I know that when I do such 
thing, my actual data may receive more error, as my human and sensor error is 
propagated from the multiplication (x = r*sin(theta) and y = r*cos(theta)).</p>
<p class="auto-style4">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style16"><strong><a name="New_Result">New Result</a></strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4">As predicted, the standard deviation and mean of both X 
and Y have decreased along with the deviation of the distance (by half!). As I 
have not fine tuned the network of the Cartesian method, this method can be 
drastically improved. Overall, this method is a better way to approach the IR 
values because now, the distribution of the difference in predicted and actual 
looks relatively normal and symmetrical unlike the Polar method.
<span class="auto-style7">I can now assume that my network can predict about 65% 
of my IR readings to about 2 balls width (15cm).</span></p>

<p class="auto-style4">The goal of the project is to find a method to accurately 
predict where the ball is given the raw sensor values of the HiTechnic IR 
Seekers. I have demonstrated that the Neural Network has worked to a 
satisfactory level and can still be improved upon by fine tuning. I discussed 
with Harvard Statistics Professor Meng who advised me to use
<span class="auto-style13">Factor Analysis to reduce the amount of inputs in my 
neural network</span>. In the next phase, I will be testing whether the neural 
network improves my performance.</p>

<p class="auto-style4">I am currently a Junior at Montgomery Highschool. I have 
been repeatedly representing the nation in Robo Cup Junior and am always finding 
ways to improve my soccer playing robots. I really like to use robust methods 
like math to explain the world. I always try to incorporate whatever I learn to 
everything else that I do. The Neural Network is a project that I have been 
working with Professor Tuckerman of New York University and is an idea that I 
have been truly eager to apply to my other projects such as RCJ. I am a Gold 
League member in USA Computing Olympiad since 2015 and am a USA Physics Olympiad 
Semifinalist. The skills and concepts that I learn in Computer Science and 
Physics helps me create more ideas to improve all aspects of my life.</p>
